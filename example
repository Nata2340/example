For improved visualization, here's a simplified example script provided below. Please note that this is a basic representation, but it should help with better understanding.


import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read CSV file
df = pd.read_csv("csv_file.csv")

# Convert the "Time" column to hours
'''
Note that the time formats could vary significantly depending on the file (or including spaces before the time format) 
Some examples of different time/date formats are: 1 d 10:53:22.00, 10:53:22, 04.07.2023 10:53:22. The preferred time format is: 0.0000 [h]
'''
df["Time"] = pd.to_timedelta(df["Time"]).dt.total_seconds() / 3600

# Function to delete non-important columns
'''
It would be important to be able to choose the columns to be deleted and also to be able to choose the number of rows that are important for the plot
'''
def delete_columns(df, columns):
    df.drop(columns=columns, inplace=True)

# Call the function to delete non-important columns
delete_columns(df, ["Spalte1", "Spalte2"])

# Function to plot the chart
'''
For the charts, it would be important to be able to choose primary and secondary y- and x-axes
'''
def plot_diagram(df, x_column, y_column):
    plt.plot(df[x_column], df[y_column])
    plt.xlabel(x_column)
    plt.ylabel(y_column)
    plt.show()

# Call the function to plot the chart
plot_diagram(df, "Time", "column3")
